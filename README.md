Description: 
This is a complete web application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). It offers an all-around platform for managing stock and monitoring sales for small to medium- sized enterprises. The application has such features as listing of products, stock tracking, monitoring sales, user login, and reporting dashboards. 


Problem Statement:
Small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) usually have problems with inventory mismanagement, no real-time tracking, and inefficient sales processes. Most use outmoded techniques such as spreadsheets or manual input, which can cause errors, stockouts, overstocking, and revenue loss. There is a need to create an affordable, effective, and simple-to-use digital solution to automate these operations.


Current Applications:
 Zoho Inventory
 QuickBooks Commerce
 Square Point of Sale (POS)
 Vend TradeGecko (now QuickBooks Commerce)

These applications have powerful features but may be too costly or complicated for SMEs. A bespoke MERN-based solution can offer a more adaptive and cost-saving alternative.

Uniqueness:  
What makes this application stand out is its flexibility and open-source nature. Contrary to most commercial inventory management systems, this MERN-based solution is entirely customizable to meet specific business requirements. It offers role-based access control, real-time updates through WebSockets, and easy-to-use dashboards intended for non-technical users. Additionally, its modular structure enables easy addition of extra features such as barcode scanning, supplier management, and mobile responsiveness, enabling it to be future-proof.

Tools and Software Used:
 Frontend: React.js, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap/Tailwind CSS
 Backend: Node.js, Express.js
 Database: MongoDB (NoSQL)
 Authentication: JWT or Firebase Authentication
 Hosting/Deployment: Vercel/Netlify (Frontend), Render/Heroku (Backend), MongoDB Atlas (Database) 
Version Control: Git and GitHub


WORK PLAN
Day 1:
Create GitHub repo + initialize Node.js project.
Install basic backend dependencies.

Day 2:
Set up Express server (index.js / server.js).
Set up environment variables using.env.

Day 3:
Connect to MongoDB using Mongoose.

Set up MongoDB Atlas or local MongoDB. 

Day 4:
Design and create MongoDB schemas:
User, Product, Sale, InventoryLog, Store

Day 5:
Create basic routes for Product:
GET /products
POST /products
PUT /products/:id
DELETE /products/:id

Day 6–7:
Implement validation (using express-validator or Mongoose).
Test routes using Postman or Thunder Client.
 Week 2: Auth & Role Management

Day 8:
Implement User registration and login routes.
Install JWT

Day 9:
Hash passwords, create JWTs on login.


Day 10:
Implement authentication middleware to check tokens.

Day 11:
Include role field in User model (e.g., "admin", "manager", "cashier").
Implement middleware for role-based access control (RBAC).


Day 12:
Secure product routes (e.g., only admins can delete).
Implement a basic GET /me route for retrieving user information.

Day 13–14:
Test full user flow:
Register → Login → Access routes
Create dummy users with various roles in DB.

Week 3: Sales, Inventory Logic & Reporting
Day 15:
Design and implement Sale model (date, products, amount, etc.)

Day 17:
On new sale: automatically update product stock.
Add logs to Inventory log collection.

Day 18:
Add low-stock checker (GET /alerts/low-stock).

Day 19:
Build reporting endpoints:



Day 20–21:
Test sale + stock interaction deeply.
Simulate multiple sales + see inventory impact.

 Week 4: Polish, Testing & Documentation
Day 22:
Clean up code with improved folder structure:

Day 23:
Add Swagger or Postman Collection documentation.

Day 24:
Error handling middleware.
Add try-catch to controllers.

Day 25:
Set up deployment-ready config.
Add CORS, secure headers (helmet), logging (morgan).

Day 26:
Test everything: All endpoints, edge cases.

Day 27:
Deploy backend to Render/Heroku.

Set up MongoDB Atlas for production.

Day 28:
Final cleanup + prepare for frontend integration.
Export Postman collection for testing frontend.


 Week 5: Start Frontend Development (React)
